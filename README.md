## Interesting Article
- [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)

## Why it's interesting
I found this article interesting because it gives a clear and practical format for commit messages, instead of vague advice. It explains why the first line should be short, why using the imperative mood helps, and how a good commit message makes the project history easier to read and review. This made me realize that writing commit messages is part of good engineering communication, not just a “git requirement”.

It also changed how I think about collaboration. In team projects, people often search git history to understand when a change was introduced, why it was done, or how to revert it safely. If commit messages are messy, that process becomes slow and confusing. So improving commit messages is an easy habit that can reduce friction for the whole team.# Git Practice
